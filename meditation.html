			<h4>What Is Meditaiton<h4>
			<img src="meditate4.jpg">
			<p>what meditation is? How does one define or achieve this type of luxury? Well one cannot be atoned for what they seek, they must let go of eveerything around them in thier mind and let it come in its own way. With even thinking they are in such a state, but if one does not acknowldege it how does one know they are meditating? If it has tuned to being able to have consciousness and awareness. The consciness cannot be on type of thing, only can be on nothing.<p>

			<h4>If meditation is on nothing then why meditate?</h4>
			<img src="meditate3.jpg">
			<p>well there is a reason to meditation but you have to grasp the concept that mediation is not the real of this form of self slumber, it has no name or discription. All it is being able to cope that you have gained freedom from mental jail known as distractions or ones mind.</p>

			<h4> Where did this type of practice come from?<h4>
			<img src="meditate2.jpg">		
			<p>it has been around centuries upon centuries. when man had first found selfawareness and being able to think, he was able to act through ones conciouness and as a being that became aware of his mental faculties and have the understanding his place in the universe and his mind. This practice was found by Native Americans which orginally called it as "tantra" which the hunters had used to gain different types of conciousness while looking into the flames as part of thier ritual to meditation.</p>
